# Java-projects
All of my Java projects
Vending Machine:
A Java project that taught me how to build menus and how to use objects. It uses a logger to track purchases and can uses oop to give each properties to the various snacks.
This project was very rough around the edges, but I love it because it shows where I began as a programmer. I worked on this project with Dughlas Hashbarger

Tenmo:
A venmo clone, Tenmo transfers t-bucks between accounts. I utilized Springboot, Java, Postgress, DBvisualizer and Postman to work on this project. 
Tenmo can create accounts with authorization, work with multiple data-bases, show transfer history, and transfer money. I learned how to build a RESTful API and work with 
databases through java. I worked on this project with Ashley Hoffman.

Tic tac toe:
A cool java project I learned from youtuber Alex Lee. It taught me some creative ways to utilize strings in java, and how to use the random function. It was a cool project to show 
friends and family. If you lose, you really suck at tic tac toe.

Budget:
I wanted to build a side project I could utilize myself so I built a budgeting app. Ive tried using budget apps before but they had to many features. I wanted a barebones app
that would tell me my savings, goals, weekly budget, and would let me quickly add and subtract from them. utilized Springboot, Java, Postgress, DBvisualizer and Postman to 
work on this project. It was very similar to Tenmo, minus the authorization, so I was able to look at that as a model. I cleaned up the process quite a bit, and was able to 
complete this project with half the man power in half the time. Im very proud of this project because Its the first original code I've written.
